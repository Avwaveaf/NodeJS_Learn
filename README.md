# My Personal Node js learning

## Node Learn-Create-Dir

This Node.js script, named `learn-create-dir.js`, leverages Node code invocation targeting specific files as arguments. For further details, refer to the source code in the `learn-create-dir.js` file.

This Node.js script, named `learn-create-dir.js`, allows you to create a new project directory with essential files. Follow the instructions below to use the script:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the `learn-create-dir.js` script is located.

3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   node learn-create-dir.js [project name]
   ```

   Replace `[project name]` with the desired name for your project.

4. If successful, the script will create a new directory with the specified project name (or a default name if none is provided) and initialize it with essential files.

## Example

To create a new project named "my-awesome-project," run the following command:

```bash
node learn-create-dir.js my-awesome-project
```

The script will generate a directory structure and files for your project.

## Notes

- If no project name is provided, the script will generate a default name using the current timestamp.

- The script will create a main project directory, a `src` subfolder, and initialize files such as `initFile.txt`, `index.html` (using boilerplate), `index.css`, and `package.json`.

- After running the script, execute the following command in the terminal to install project dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm i
  ```

Congratulations! Your project is now set up and ready for further development.

Feel free to customize the generated files according to your project requirements.
